    text: "I requested a metal 14x32 shed. Let me just say, it turned out everything I pictured and more. They did an amazing job on the build. You can tell they truly put their best effort into it and took their time to make sure it was done right. I'm 10/10 extremely happy & thankful for it! Not only is the shed great but the customer service was on point. Always replied when needed to & answered every question. Even worked with me on last minutes changes the best they could! Highly recommend & will use them again for any future needs.",

It was a joy to watch them set up the unit. I've recommended them to family and currently my daughter is in the process of buying her unit from Gino. Five stars isn't enough for the experience with Summit.",
